Are you and your colleagues spending too much time on menial tasks that could be solved by a machine? Or perhaps you are considering investing in infrastructure that will help you do all your data operations more efficiently?

## Experience

I have many years experience programming and developing systems to solve complex problems. Here, I will give you some examples of projects I have worked on.

When I worked at [FarGen](https://www.fargen.fo/), I was involved in building research infrastructure for processing and managing DNA sequencing data. I was involved all the way from deciding what hardware to use, to setting up the interface that the end-user saw. The result is my proudest achievement, which I called the **FarGen High-Throughput Cluster**, or FarGen HTC for short.

Processing large amounts of data can become extremely time-consuming without some degree of automation. While at FarGen, I developed [LinkSeq](https://github.com/fargenfo/linkseq), a pipeline that automates all steps involved in processing DNA sequencing data. In addition, the FarGen HTC was leveraged to parallelize the pipeline to shorten the processing time and to reduce manual work by submitting many samples simultanously.

I was involved with developing the navigation system of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) referred to as *Hugin* in the Kongsberg Group. For example, we developed a new module to detect problems with the navigation solution, and to enable the vehicle to restart, or *re-initialize*, its own navigation system with no human interference what-so-ever.
