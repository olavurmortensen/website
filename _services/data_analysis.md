Can machine learning help you uncover hidden patterns in your data? Or maybe you need the power of big data to organize and summarize large amounts of data?

## Experience

I have worked with data analysis most of my adult life, and will give you some examples of projects I've worked on.

As a researcher and bioinformatician in the [FarGen](https://www.fargen.fo/) project one of my responsibilities was to analyse the DNA sequencing data coming out of the lab. This meant processing the raw sequencing data to "human readable" genetic variant data, and doing various statistical analyses that were of interest to our research group. This work culminated in a peer-reviewed scientific paper that I am the main author of:

> **Mortensen, Ó.**,  Thomsen, E., Lydersen, L., Apol, K., Weihe, P., Steig, B., Andorsdóttir, G., Als, T. & Gregersen, N. (2022). *FarGen: Elucidating the distribution of coding variants in the isolated population of the Faroe Islands*. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-022-01227-2)

At FarGen I also worked with a completely different type of data, namely genealogical records, i.e. family trees. The results of this work were used in several projects, including the paper listed above, and another paper by [Johansen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2020.1813311). I built a tool that I named [PedGraph -- Multilayer networks for pedigree analysis](https://github.com/olavurmortensen/pedgraph) to streamline analyses of these genealogical records.

In 2017, I developed a machine learning module for a consulting company called RaRe Technologies. The module tackles a problem in *Natural Language Processing* (NLP), which helps machines to understand natural text. I developed an algorithm to optimize the problem that the model tries to solve, and implemented this in the [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) library. You can read about this work in a tutorial in the [RaRe Technologies blog](https://rare-technologies.com/new-gensim-feature-author-topic-modeling-lda-with-metadata/).
